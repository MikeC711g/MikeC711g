- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikeC711g
- 👀 I’m interested in ... general "tech".  I ended my 35 year IT career in 2018 and now manage the rentals I bought during that career (more laid back).  
  I am working on an Angular app that uses a Go server with SqlLite3 as a back end.  Currently all running on my Ubuntu notebook ... but I plan to move the
  server side to my Ubuntu miniTower upstairs (which I don't currently leave on all the time).  If I allow others to try it (I couldn't find accounting
  software that did what I wanted (tracked transactions in all of my accounts and tied them to houses and projects), I may blow the budget and grab an ubuntu
  image through a cloud provider.  Probably prefer not to use AWS only because I'm not a big fan of cancel culture.  I realize, however, my $25/month or so is
  not likely to make or break a company with > $1T valuation.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Not from a brand new perspective, but certainly brushing up and increasing skills in Angular, Go, and git.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Not sure yet
- 📫 How to reach me ... Best to eMail me at mikec711g@gmail.com
